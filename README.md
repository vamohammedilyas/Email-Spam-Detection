## Project Overview
The **Email Spam Detection** project is a machine learning-based application that classifies emails as **spam or non-spam (ham)**. The model is trained on a dataset of emails and uses **text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms** to accurately detect spam emails. This helps improve email management and security by automatically filtering unwanted messages.

## Features
- Classifies emails as **spam** or **ham (non-spam)**.  
- Preprocesses email content (removing punctuation, stopwords, and applying tokenization).  
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.  
- Built with **Python** and **Scikit-learn** machine learning algorithms.  
- Provides accuracy metrics and model evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for the project.  
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Data manipulation and processing.  
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning model implementation.  
- **NLTK / Text Processing Libraries:** Text preprocessing.
